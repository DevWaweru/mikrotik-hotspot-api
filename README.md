## Automated mikrotik hotspot service
### November 6th, 2018

### Description
This service automates the process of manually adding, changing and removing a user from the mikrotik hotspot.

Internet users create and/or change their log in credentials for accessing the internet. Their credentials become active only when they have made a payment.

Payments are made using M-Pesa API. However, integration with other payment systems can be done.

All payments are recorded, and the admin has a visual representation of the amount earned per month on a graph. The admin panel shows active users and all users on the mikrotik router. 
**The admin dashboard can only be viewed by the admin** and is inaccessible by other users.

Admin is responsible for checking for expired users. The process is done automatically after 6 hours is admin is lazy.
